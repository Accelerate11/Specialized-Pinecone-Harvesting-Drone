# Specialized-Pinecone-Harvesting-Drone

To address the issues of high safety risks and low efficiency associated with manual pinecone harvesting, as well as the significant damage and loss caused by vibratory harvesters, this project has developed an intelligent pinecone harvesting system that deeply integrates a UAV, a robotic arm, and a striking end-effector.

The system employs a coaxial oct-rotor platform to achieve maneuverable flight within forest environments. It establishes a pinecone recognition system for precise target positioning and proposes a path planning method that simultaneously considers attitude, position, and obstacles, ensuring a safe and efficient approach to the pinecones. Additionally, an integrated cooperative control dynamic model for the UAV and the robotic arm is established to enhance operational stability.

This system enables rapid identification, precise harvesting, and stable flight in complex forest environments. It effectively reduces labor costs, improves harvesting efficiency, minimizes fruit loss, alleviates labor intensity, mitigates operational risks, and contributes to the modernization of forestry.

This project selects the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano as the onboard computer, the CUAV X7 as the flight controller, the DJI Mid-360 as the LiDAR, the SIYI A8 mini as the gimbal camera, and an RGB-D Sensor Camera（https://wiki.dfrobot.com.cn/_SKU_SEN0583_RGB-D_Sensor_Camera） as the depth camera.
